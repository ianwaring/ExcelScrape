Quick hack using Beautiful Soup to explode Excel CSV BoM Data into Component Detail

Originally used to take a download of Patterns data in Excel CSV from a Magento system, and break out the Wools and Materials 
needed to build each from a variable length of SKU text:value pairings in one of the spreadsheet columns. Used as a one off 
exercise to explode likely pattern sales data into an initial warehouse inventory profile for the goods needed to build
the finished products. The CSV file is not included, given it is proprietary and commercially sensitive to the eCommerce 
vendor.

The scraper.py code was a different test hack while looking at Beautiful Soup - to list out contacts from an external 
UK CEO database.
